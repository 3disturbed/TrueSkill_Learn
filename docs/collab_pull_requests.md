# Collaborating with Pull Requests

## Creating a Pull Request
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.

1. **Go to the Pull Requests Tab**
   - Navigate to your repository on GitHub and click on the **Pull Requests** tab.

2. **New Pull Request**
   - Click **New pull request**.
   - Select the branch you want to merge into the base branch, usually `main`.

3. **Submit Pull Request**
   - Click **Create pull request**.
   - Fill in the title and description for your pull request.
   - Click **Create pull request** again to submit.

## Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests
- **Reviewing**: Team members can review the pull request, leave comments, and request changes.
- **Merging**: Once the pull request is approved, click **Merge pull request** to merge the changes into the base branch.
- **Closing**: If the pull request is not needed, it can be closed without merging.
